📊 UIDAI Aadhaar Performance Analysis Dashboard


Analytics

🏆 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard created for UIDAI Hackathon 2026, focusing on Aadhaar enrollment, demographic updates, and biometric performance analysis across India.

The dashboard highlights data-driven insights while also addressing a critical real-world problem:
➡️ Inconsistent and unclean State/District location data in Aadhaar datasets.

A complete video explanation of the dashboard is also included for better understanding.

🎯 Problem Statement

Government datasets like Aadhaar operate at a massive scale. During analysis, we observed:

Inconsistent State and District names
Duplicate records due to spelling variations
Outdated or unofficial location names

Examples:

Orissa instead of Odisha
Ponducherry instead of Puducherry
Multiple spellings of Jammu & Kashmir

These issues cause:

Incorrect aggregations
Misleading dashboards
Poor decision-making

💡 Proposed Solution
✅ Standardized Location Entry System

Replace free-text entry with official dropdown selections

Use UIDAI-approved master lists for:

State
District
Sub-district

Prevent invalid or unofficial entries at the source

📌 Outcome: Clean, consistent, and reliable Aadhaar datasets.
